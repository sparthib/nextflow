We’ll see how to include other languages later in the tutorial.\nStep 3: Save the file and run the script by typing nextflow script.nf in the terminal.\nNow, in order to run this process, it has to be called. Analogous to calling a python function on its main function,\nIn your .nf file, paste the below snippet.\n```{nextflow}\nworkflow {\n    sayHello()\n}\n```\nNow, you can run your .nf script using the command nextflow run script.nf in the terminal.\nIf your script runs without any error, you’ll see an output declaring that 100% of the process has been executed such as below.\n```{bash}\nN E X T F L O W  ~  version 23.10.0\nLaunching `hello_world.nf` [naughty_kalman] DSL2 - revision: 3d162a2807\nexecutor &gt;  local (1)\n[ac/d7ee11] process &gt; sayHello [100%] 1 of 1 ✔\n```"
